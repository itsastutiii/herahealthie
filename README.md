## 🌍 Introduction 
Despite comprising half of the global population, women’s health remains significantly underfunded and under-researched, leading to delayed diagnoses, limited treatment options, and diminished quality of life. Conditions such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, PCOS, and severe menstrual pain continue to affect millions of women, yet healthcare systems lack the necessary tools for early detection and personalized management.

HeraHealth is an AI-powered platform designed to bridge this gap by offering a comprehensive, personalized approach to reproductive health.
